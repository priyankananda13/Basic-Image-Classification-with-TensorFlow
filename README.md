# Basic-Image-Classification-with-TensorFlow
This hands on project on Basic Image Classification with Keras and TensorFlow is divided into following tasks:

### Task 1: Introduction
Introduction to the basic image classification problem.
Importing TensorFlow library.

### Task 2: The Dataset
Importing the MNIST dataset.
A quick look at the structure of the dataset.
A quick look at the MNIST image examples.

### Task 3: One Hot Encoding
How to encode the labels from the dataset.

### Task 4: Pre-processing the Examples
Unrolling the input features.
Data normalization with mean and standard deviation.

### Task 5: Creating the Model
Creating a sequential model with Keras.
Model architecture - hidden layers and hidden units.
Softmax and ReLU activation functions.
Compiling the model by specifying an optimizer and a loss function.

### Task 6: Training the Model
Training the model to fit to training data.
Evaluating the model on the test data.

### Task 7: Predictions
Predictions on the test set.
Visualizing the predictions.
